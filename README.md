# 🚀 Resume Matcher  
### The **VS Code for Making Resumes** — Built to Beat ATS, Not Humans

> **Stop getting auto-rejected by bots.**  
> Resume Matcher is an **AI-powered, local-first resume engineering platform** that reverse-engineers Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and shows you *exactly* how to tailor your resume for any job — keywords, structure, scoring, and improvements — all in one place.

🔥 **Think of it as VS Code + GitHub Copilot for resumes.**  
⚡ Fast. Private. Developer-grade. Open Source.
